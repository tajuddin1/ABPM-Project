                        While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="mt-4">Device Identifier</h6>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        The device identifier is a small amount of data that your device's operating system manages and provides to the app. The data uniquely identifies your device. The app may transmit the device identifier to ABPM in order to register your device for opt-in services such as push notifications.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="mt-4">App Version Number</h6>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        The app version number is a sequential number that identifies what version of the app you are using. The number may be transmitted to ABPM when the app requests information from ABPM's web server, such as when viewing content that was not built into the app but instead originates from the server.
