                    <p>The information below is for Members that currently hold Board Certification classification only.&nbsp; Advertising Board Qualified classification is strictly prohibited.</p>
                    <h3 class="f_s_18 mt-4">Advertising Board Certification</h3>
                    <p class="mt-0">A Diplomate of the ABPM must adhere to the following advertising guidelines:</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">Only the following statements are acceptable for this purpose:</p>
                    <ol class="py-1 px-3  ml-4">
                        <li>Diplomate, American Board of Podiatric Medicine</li>
                        <li>Board Certified, American Board of Podiatric Medicine</li>
                        <li>Certified American Board of Podiatric Medicine</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-3">The organization's initials (ABPM) may be substituted for the full name.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">The letter “D” may be substituted for the word Diplomate.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">For Diplomates holding a Certificate of Added Qualification, the following advertising guidelines apply:</p>
                    <ul class="py-1 px-3  ml-4">
                        <li>Diplomate with Certificate of Added Qualification in Amputation Prevention and Wound Care</li>
                        <li>CAQ in Amputation Prevention and Wound Care</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-3">Advertising board qualified classification is prohibited.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">The Board of Directors shall have the authority to revoke a member for failure to adhere to the advertising guidelines.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3"><em>Note: The CAQ in amputation prevention and wound care is issued solely by the ABPM to its diplomates.&nbsp; The Joint Committee on Recognition of Specialty Boards (JCRSB) of the Council on Podiatric Medical Education recognizes the certification process of the ABPM but has not developed a recognition process for certificates of added qualification.&nbsp; Therefore, at this time the ABPM's recognition by the JCRSB does not extend specifically to the CAQ.</em></p>
                    <h3 class="f_s_18 mt-4">Use of ABPM Logo</h3>
                    <p class="mt-0">Diplomates wishing to utilize the ABPM logo in advertising their certification with the board may do so without restriction so long as the advertising is otherwise consistent with Board policy and the APMA code of ethics. Interested Diplomates may obtain a Board approved image of the logo from the "members only" section of the Board's website. Only unmodified images of the exact form of the logo obtained from the website may be used in this connection.</p>
                    <h3 class="f_s_18 mt-4">Use of ABPM Board Certified Logo for Website</h3>
                    <p class="mt-0">Diplomates are encouraged to use the logo on their website as they feel appropriate. The use of the ABPM Board Certified logo is intended to promote your classification as a Diplomate of the Board for patients, colleagues and the health care industry visiting your website.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">Only ABPM Diplomates who carry active status are authorized to use the logo. Therefore, where group podiatric practice is concerned only the active Diplomate can have the logo accompany their name on the website, and the placement of the logo must clearly indicate which podiatric physician is an active Diplomate of ABPM.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">Diplomates are encouraged to add a hyperlink www.ABPMed.org to the Board Certified logo. In this way, patients and credentialers may have immediate access to information about the ABPM.</p>
