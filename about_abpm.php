                    <p>The American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM) exists to protect the health and welfare of the public through an ongoing process of evaluation and certification of the competence of podiatrists in the specialty of podiatric orthopedics and primary podiatric medicine by offering podiatric physicians a comprehensive board qualification and certification process.</p>

                    <h6>What is the American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM)?</h6>
                    <p>The American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM) offers a comprehensive board qualification and certification process in podiatric medicine and orthopedics.
                        <br> <br>
                        Podiatric Medicine and Orthopedics is the medical specialty concerned with the comprehensive and continuous foot health care of patients. It integrates the biological, biomechanical, rehabilitative, clinical and behavioral sciences and encompasses first contact care, continuous care, long term care and general medicine.
                        <br> <br>
                        Board certification provides the assurance to both the public and health professionals that the highest level of achievement has been attained in the specialty area.
                        <br><br>
                        While certification by the Board does not guarantee competence in practice, it does indicate that the podiatric physician has been judged by his peers to have demonstrated, via a rigorous examination process, a fund of knowledge and competence in the areas being tested.
                        <br><br>
                        The Certificate of the American Board of Podiatric Medicine is a unique achievement-a step well beyond the mandatory education of the podiatrist or state requirements for licensure.
                        <br><br>
                        The American Board of Podiatric Medicine is recognized by the Joint Committee on the Recognition of Specialty Boards of the Council on Podiatric Medical Education under the authority of the American Podiatric Medical Association as the specialty board to conduct a certification process in Podiatric Orthopedics and Primary Podiatric Medicine. Recognition is an indication of satisfactory compliance with the recognition criteria as well as public approbation, attesting to the competency and proficiency of the specialty board to assure that only qualified podiatrists have obtained certified status.

                    <br><br>
                    <h6>What Does ABPM Do?</h6>
                    <p>
                        The Board arranges and conducts a comprehensive examination process heading to Board certification and grants and issues Diplomate certificates to successful candidates duly licensed to practice podiatric medicine. The Board holds the power to revoke such certificates. The Board endeavors to serve hospitals and the health care industry in general by preparing documentation of podiatric physicians who it has qualified or certified and provides primary source verification of their status in the accreditation process. Inquiries regarding a member's status must be expressed in writing to Board Headquarters to be considered official.
                        <br><br>
                        The Board makes no attempt to control the practice of its members by license or legal regulation, and does not interfere with or limit the professional activities of any duly licensed podiatric physician. The Board does, however, issue advertising and ethics guidelines with respect to appropriate use of Diplomate status, and reserves the right to withdraw such status if guidelines are not properly adhered to.
